> This repository is for learning purposes. It may intentionally contain bugs or
fail to function properly. The code may be purposefully difficult to read,
contain syntax errors, or only be a partial solution. You should not base code
off of this and absolutely should not use it in production.

This project attempts to isolate components of an Express app and test them
individually. It separates the route definitions from their implementations and
targets each type with individualized tests.
